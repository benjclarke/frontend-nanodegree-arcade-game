# Installation

Pull down from github https://github.com/benjclarke/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game onto your local machine 

Run index.html 

## Issues

The player doesn't actually reach the top of the screen when the alert pops - the issue is that the incremental move from the Y postion to the next Y position meets the requirements of the Check in player.prototype.update - I have tried to play with the numbers to get it closer.

### Play

Use the arrow keys to play - don't hit the bugs
